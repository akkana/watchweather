# watchweather

Display the output of multiple temperature stations on one page.

For instance, you can set up several Raspberry Pis around the house,
each with a temperature/humidity sensor, and display the output from
all of them on one page.

This is not limited to weather data: you could use the framework for
any quantities you want to report. It would be better to have a
more general name, and if I think of a good name I'll rename the
repository.
